-- With this code I created a "workout" table, containing a primary key, type of workout, number of reps, and number of calories burnt for each workout.
-- I inserted some values into the table, I then updated some of the records to change the number of reps and calories. 
-- Finally I deleted the records corresponding to the "push ups" workout and selected all records from the table to make sure I got the result I wanteed.
CREATE TABLE workout (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, type TEXT, reps INTEGER, calories INTEGER);
