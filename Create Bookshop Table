-- With this code I created a "bookshop" table, containing a unique identifier for each of the books, the title, price, quantity stocked, 
-- and aisle in which the book can be found. I then ordered the books by increasing price, took stock by selecting the total quantity of books, 
-- and identified the highest priced book. 

CREATE TABLE bookshop (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, price INTEGER, quantity INTEGER, aisle INTEGER);

INSERT INTO bookshop VALUES (1, "1984", 15, 3, 4);
INSERT INTO bookshop VALUES (2, "A brave new world", 10, 2, 4);
INSERT INTO bookshop VALUES (3, "Lord of the flies", 12, 4, 4);
INSERT INTO bookshop VALUES (4, "Young Werther", 14, 1, 2);
INSERT INTO bookshop VALUES (5, "Woyzieck", 3, 1, 2);

INSERT INTO bookshop VALUES (7, "Before the coffee gets cold", 4, 10, 1);
INSERT INTO bookshop VALUES (8, "No longer human", 2, 12, 1);
